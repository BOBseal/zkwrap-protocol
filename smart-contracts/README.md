# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts
npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network mainnet {deploy on mainnet}
```

contract on testnet =   0xE5c005FEfb767aA1e842aE8c55679E502f5887fD

prev tx test = 0x0a642cdc3b5562b816c1d556920fac50f0eb56f4f95634f8cee77cc2d83ced25
